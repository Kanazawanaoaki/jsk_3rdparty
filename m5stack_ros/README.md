# m5stack_ros

Connect the devices to ROS via [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/) and [rosserial](https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial).

## Usage

1. Create ROS workspace

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/catkin_ws/src -p
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    wstool init
    wstool merge https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty/master/m5stack_ros/m5stack_ros.rosinstall
    wstool up
    rosdep install --ignore-src --from-path . -y -r
    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin build m5stack_ros
    ```

2. Setup [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) for M5Stack

  - Download arduino IDE file and install it under home directory like `~/arduino-1.8.16`.
    ```bash
    ARDUINO_VERSION=1.8.16 # Set your Arduino version to environment variable
    cd ~
    tar xvf ~/Downloads/arduino-$ARDUINO_VERSION-linux64.tar.xz
    ```

  - Setup linux system for Arduino IDE

    ```bash
    ~/arduino-$ARDUINO_VERSION/arduino-linux-setup.sh $USER
    ```

  - Add esp32 to board manager
    - Open arduino IDE. `~/arduino-$ARDUINO_VERSION/arduino`
    - Add following Boards Manager URLs (File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager URLs -> Click icon)
      - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`
      - `https://m5stack.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/resource/arduino/package_m5stack_index.json`
    - Install esp32 by Espressif Systems (Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager -> esp32)
    - Install M5Stack by M5Stack (Tools -> Manage Libraries -> M5Stack)
    - Select M5Stack-Core-ESP32 Board (Tools -> Board -> ESP32 Arduino -> M5Stack-Core-ESP32)

  - Create Symlink from m5stack_ros library to arduino library

    ```bash
    ln -s $HOME/catkin_ws/src/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty/m5stack_ros/include $HOME/arduino-$ARDUINO_VERSION/libraries/m5stack_ros
    ```

  - Make rosserial_arduino libraries

    ```bash
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    cd ~/arduino-$ARDUINO_VERSION/libraries
    rm -rf ros_lib
    rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .
    ```

3. Burn firmware for each device. Available devices are listed in [Devices](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty/tree/master/m5stack_ros#devices) section.

  - Launch Arduino IDE

    ```bash
    ~/arduino-$ARDUINO_VERSION/arduino
    ```

  - Select USB port of M5Stack (Tools -> Port -> /dev/ttyUSB*)

  - Define macro at the beginning of `include/m5stack_ros.h` based on connection type between M5Stack and PC

    - Bluetooth

      ```C
      #define ROSSERIAL_ARDUINO_BLUETOOTH
      ```

    - Wi-Fi

      ```C
      #define ROSSERIAL_ARDUINO_TCP
      ```

    - USB

      ```C
      // define nothing
      ```

  - If you use Wi-Fi, set SSID and password in `include/wifi.h`. **DO NOT** upload these information to github.

4.  Start main program

  - Connect M5Stack and the device with cable.

  - Connect M5Stack and PC

    - If you use Bluetooth connection, exec following commands. For detail, see [PR](https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/pull/569).

      ```bash
      sudo rfcomm bind 1 <Bluetooth MAC Address of M5Stack>
      sudo stty -F /dev/rfcomm1 115200 cs8
      ```

      - When using for the first time, it is necessary to execute the following to pair.
        ```bash
	bluetoothctl
	scan on # check MAC address of your device
	scan off
	pair <MAC address of your device>
	trust <MAC address of your device>
	connect <MAC address of your device>
	info <MAC address of your device> # check if your device is successfully connected
        ```

      - Bluetooth MAC Address is printed on Arduino IDE Serial Monitor when M5Stack is started.

      - If you use the same device repeatedly, I recommend you to add these commands to init daemon like upstart or systemd.

  - source setup.bash

    ```bash
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    ```

  - Launch ROS program. For detail, please see [Devices](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty/tree/master/m5stack_ros#devices) section.

    - For USB, (USB serial seems to be max 57600 baud rate)

      ```bash
      roslaunch m5stack_ros [device].launch baud:=57600 port:=(USB DEVICE like /dev/ttyUSB0)
      ```

    - For Bluetooth,

      ```bash
      roslaunch m5stack_ros [device].launch baud:=115200 port:=/dev/rfcomm1
      ```

    - For Wi-Fi,

      ```bash
      roslaunch m5stack_ros [device].launch baud:=115200 port:=tcp
      ```
